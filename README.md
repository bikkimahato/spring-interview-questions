# Spring Core Easy Interview Questions and Answers
### 1. What is the Spring Framework?

The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It was initially released in 2003 by Rod Johnson. Spring makes it easier to create enterprise-level applications by providing various modules and extensions to build robust and maintainable applications.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--spring-core-easy)**
---

### 2. What are the advantages of using Spring Framework?

- **Modularity**: Spring is divided into several modules, allowing developers to use only the parts they need.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling by allowing objects to be injected into other objects.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Helps separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management.
- **Transaction Management**: Simplifies the management of transactions.
- **Integration with Other Frameworks**: Easily integrates with other frameworks like Hibernate, JPA, and Struts.
- **Testability**: Provides support for unit testing and integration testing.
- **Community Support**: Large community and extensive documentation.

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--spring-core-easy)**
---

### 3. Explain Dependency Injection.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows an object to be created and injected with its dependencies by an external entity. This promotes loose coupling between objects and enhances testability and maintainability.

**Example:**

```java
// Service interface
public interface MessageService {
    void sendMessage(String message, String receiver);
}

// Service implementation
public class EmailService implements MessageService {
    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, String receiver) {
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + receiver + " with Message: " + message);
    }
}

// Consumer class
public class MyApplication {
    private MessageService service;

    // Constructor-based dependency injection
    public MyApplication(MessageService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void processMessage(String message, String receiver) {
        service.sendMessage(message, receiver);
    }
}

// Main class
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Injecting dependency
        MessageService service = new EmailService();
        MyApplication app = new MyApplication(service);
        app.processMessage("Hello", "john@example.com");
    }
}
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--spring-core-easy)**
---

### 4. What are the different types of Dependency Injection?

- **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
- **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
- **Interface Injection**: Dependencies are provided through an interface method (less common).

#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--spring-core-easy)**
---

### 5. What is the BeanFactory in Spring?

BeanFactory is the root interface for accessing a Spring bean container. It provides the configuration framework and basic functionality for managing beans. BeanFactory is lightweight and is typically used in simple applications or scenarios where resources are limited.

**Example:**

```java
// XML Configuration (beans.xml)
<beans>
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>
</beans>

// Java Code
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource resource = new ClassPathResource("beans.xml");
        BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(resource);
        MyBean myBean = (MyBean) factory.getBean("myBean");
        myBean.doSomething();
    }
}
```
#### **[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#level--spring-core-easy)**
---

### 6. What is the ApplicationContext in Spring?

ApplicationContext is an extension of BeanFactory that provides more advanced features. It includes functionalities such as internationalization, event propagation, declarative mechanisms to create a bean, and various ways to look up a bean. It is more feature-rich and is typically used in enterprise applications.

**Example:**

```java
// XML Configuration (beans.xml)
<beans>
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>
</beans>

// Java Code
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
        MyBean myBean = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
        myBean.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### 7. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?

| Feature            | BeanFactory                              | ApplicationContext                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Initialization     | Lazy initialization                      | Eager initialization                        |
| Advanced Features  | Limited                                  | Provides advanced features like event propagation, declarative mechanisms, etc. |

### 8. How do you configure a Spring application using XML?

**Example:**

```xml
<!-- beans.xml -->
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <property name="property" value="value"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
```

```java
// Java Code
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
        MyBean myBean = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
        myBean.doSomething();
    }
}
```

### 9. What is a Spring Bean?

A Spring Bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Beans are the fundamental building blocks of a Spring application.

**Example:**

```java
public class MyBean {
    private String property;

    public void setProperty(String property) {
        this.property = property;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Property value: " + property);
    }
}
```

```xml
<!-- beans.xml -->
<beans>
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <property name="property" value="value"/>
    </bean>
</beans>
```

### 10. What are the different scopes of Spring Beans?

- **Singleton**: Only one instance of the bean is created for the Spring container. This is the default scope.
- **Prototype**: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
- **Request**: A new instance is created for each HTTP request. Applicable only in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- **Session**: A new instance is created for each HTTP session. Applicable only in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
- **Global-session**: A single instance is created for the global HTTP session. Applicable only in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

**Example:**

```xml
<!-- beans.xml -->
<beans>
    <bean id="singletonBean" class="com.example.SingletonBean" scope="singleton"/>
    <bean id="prototypeBean" class="com.example.PrototypeBean" scope="prototype"/>
</beans>
```

```java
public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");

        // Singleton Scope
        SingletonBean singletonBean1 = (SingletonBean) context.getBean("singletonBean");
        SingletonBean singletonBean2 = (SingletonBean) context.getBean("singletonBean");
        System.out.println(singletonBean1 == singletonBean2); // true

        // Prototype Scope
        PrototypeBean prototypeBean1 = (PrototypeBean) context.getBean("prototypeBean");
        PrototypeBean prototypeBean2 = (PrototypeBean) context.getBean("prototypeBean");
        System.out.println(prototypeBean1 == prototypeBean2); // false
    }
}
```
